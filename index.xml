      <description>Semi-supervised learning is a class of supervised learning tasks and techniques that also make use of unlabeled data for training – typically a small amount of labeled data with a large amount of unlabeled data.
The Data - STL-10 In this problem we are given 5,000 labeled images and 100,000 unlabeled images. - Colored 96x96 images - Labeled images belong to one of the 10 classes - The unlabeled 100,000 images contain other classes of images as well as the 10 given classes.</description>

      <description>$r_{ij}$ -- yo
1. Problem Description We are given a rating matrix $R$ where only a small fraction of the entries $R_{ij}$ are provided; otherwise the rest is missing. The task is to predict those missing entries. As in most Machine Learning problems the assumption here is that there&amp;rsquo;s an underlying stationary pattern as to how users rate the movies.
By the nature of the problem, $R$ is a sparse matrix, where the sparsity comes not from zero entries but from empty records.</description>
