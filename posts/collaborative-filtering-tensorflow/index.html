<h2 id="1-problem-description">1. Problem Description</h2>

<p>We are given a rating matrix $R$ where only a small fraction of the entries are provided; otherwise the rest is missing. The task of a Recommender Model is to predict those missing entries. As in most Machine Learning problems the assumption here is that there&rsquo;s an underlying pattern of how users rate movies.</p>

<p>By the nature of the problem, $R$ is a sparse matrix, where the sparsity comes not from zero entries but from empty records. Therefor, we represent the training data in 3 columns: $i$: user ID , $j$: movie ID and $R_{ij}$: the rating (see Table 1).</p>

<li>All ratings are given in the interval [0.5, 5.0] with increments of 0.5:<br />

<h2 id="3-matrix-factorization-model">3. Matrix Factorization Model</h2>

<p>The terms  <em>Matrix Factorization</em>, <em>Collaborative Filtering</em>, and <em>Low-Rank Matrix Factorization</em> all refer to the same recommender system model.  In essence, this model is based on the assumption that users who liked the same movies are likely to feel similarly towards other movies.  The term <em>collaborative</em> refers to the observation that when a large set of users are involved in rating the movies, these users effectively collaborate to help the model to  better predict the movie ratings for everyone because every new rating will help the algorithm learn better features for the complete user-movie system.</p>

<p>The Collaborative Filtering Model can also be described as reconstructing a <strong>low rank approximation</strong> of matrix $R$ via its <strong>Singular Value Decomposition</strong> $R = U \cdot \Sigma \cdot V^T$. The low-rank reconstruction is achieved by only retaining the largest $k$ singular values, $R_k = U \cdot \Sigma_k \cdot V^T$.</p>

<p><strong>Eckart-Young Theorem</strong> states that if $R_k$ is the best rank-$k$ approximation of $R$, then it&rsquo;s necessary that:</p>

<p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;   1. $R_k$ minimizes the Frobenius norm $||R - R_k||_F^2$ and<br />
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;   2. $R_k$ can be constructed by retaining only the largest $k$ singular values in the diagonal matrix $\Sigma_k$ of the SVD formulation.</p>

<p>We can further absorb the diagonal matrix $\Sigma_k$ into $U$ and $V$ and express the factorization as a simple dot product between the feature matrices for users and movies.</p>

<p align="center">$\hat{R}_{k(m \times n)} = U_{(m \times k)}^\ \cdot V_{(k \times n)}^T$</p>

<p>where, the parentheses indicate matrix size.<br />
$m$: number of users ($m = 138493$)<br />
$n$: number of movies ($n = 27278$)<br />
$k$: rank hyperparameter (typically $k \approx 10$).<br />
$U$: user feature matrix<br />
$V$: movies feature matrix</p>

<p>Hence, we can formulate the problem as an <strong>optimization problem</strong> minimizing the following loss function $L$ via SGD.</p>

<p>$$argmin_{\ U,V}\ L = ||R - \hat{R}||_F^2$$</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s important to note that the Frobenius norm is computed only as a <strong>partial summation</strong> over the entries in $\hat{R}$ where a rating is provided&mdash;or equivalently over the list of ratings as shown in Table 1. The optimization procedure searches for the values of all entries in $U$ and $V$. There are $(m+n) \times k$ many such  tunable variables.</p>

<p>The hyperparameter $k$ is to be chosen carefully by cross-validation. Too small a $k$ value would not be enough to explain the pattern in the data adequately (<em>underfitting</em>), and too large a $k$ value would result in a model fitting on the random noise over the pattern (<em>overfitting</em>).</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s worth making a brief interpretation of the feature matrices $U$ and $V$. In the $k$-rank approximation scheme, each rating $R_{ij}$ is expressed as the dot product $U_i^\ \cdot V_j^T$ as shown in Figure 2. The goal of our optimization routine is for the model to learn a <strong>latent feature vector</strong> (or alternatively an <strong>embedding vector</strong>) for each user and movie.  The term <em>latent</em> implies that the features are not explicitly defined as a part of the model nor they can be interpreted definitively once the embeddings are learned. Each entry in $U_i$ and $V_j$ corresponds to the weight coefficient of an abstract feature. These features can specify the genre of the movie or how much action or drama contained in the movie or any other distinguishing quality that would help characterize how the users rate movies. Hence, the dot product representation of the ratings $R_{ij} = U_i^\ \cdot V_j^T$ expresses a <strong>linear combination</strong> of</p>

<p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; 1. how much that feature is favored by the user-$i$, and<br />
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; 2. how much that feature is contained in the movie-$j$.</p>

<h2 id="4-linear-nonlinear-and-cross-features">4. Linear, Nonlinear and Cross Features</h2>

<h5 id="linear-terms">Linear Terms:</h5>

<ul>
<li><p>Standard collaborative filtering model consists of only a linear term:
$$\hat{R}_{ij} = (R_{lin})_{ij} = U_{i}^\ \cdot V_{j}^T$$
In this dot product, $p^{th}$ feature coefficient of $U_{i}$ is multiplied with the corresponding $p^{th}$ coefficient of $V_{j}$. The contributions from each feature are added up into a total sum.</p></li>

<li><p>Subsequently, I added a sigmoid filter $R_{ij} = 4.5 \cdot \sigma(U_i^\ \cdot V_j^T) + 0.5$ which forced all output predictions into the interval [0.5, 5.0], where $\sigma$ is the sigmoid function. This small detail helped lower the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) Rate from approximately <code>.64</code> to <code>.62</code>. The reason for this is that in the absence of sigmoid activation, some predictions fall outside the natural range $[0.5, 5.0]$. Sigmoid activation squashes the predictions to the correct range and hence closer to their actual values.<br />
<br />
The MAE on the cross validation set for the pure linear model, $\hat{R} = R_{lin}$, is:
$$=&gt; Linear\ Model: MAE (CV) = 0.624$$</p></li>
</ul>

<h5 id="nonlinear-terms">Nonlinear Terms:</h5>

<ul>
<li><p>I experimented with adding a 2<sup>nd</sup> order term to the rating model:<br />
$$(R_{nl})_{ij} = \sum_{p=1}^k \Big[U_{ip} V_{jp}\Big]^2$$</p></li>

<li><p>However, the quadratic terms didn&rsquo;t result in any discernible reduction in the final error rate and it was not used in the final model.</p></li>
</ul>

<h5 id="cross-feature-terms">Cross Feature Terms:</h5>

<ul>
<li><p>Cross feature terms introduces the following 2<sup>nd</sup> order nonlinearity to the rating model:<br />
$$(R_{xft})_{ij} = \sum_{p=1}^{k}\sum_{q=1}^{k} \Big[(X_{UV})_{pq}\ U_{ip} V_{jq}\Big]$$
$$+\sum_{p=1}^{k}\sum_{q=p+1}^{k} \Big[(X_{UU})_{pq}\ U_{ip} U_{jq}+ (X_{VV})_{pq}\ V_{ip}  V_{jq}\Big]$$
where<br />
$(X_{UV})_{pq}$: user-movie cross feature coefficients between features $p$ and $q$,<br />
$(X_{UU})_{pq}$: user-user cross feature coefficients between features $p$ and $q$,<br />
$(X_{VV})_{pq}$: movie-movie cross feature coefficients between features $p$ and $q$,<br />
<br />
$X_{UV}$, $X_{UU}$, $X_{VV}$ have the size $k \times k$. Their components are to be learned by the SGD optimization algorithm.<br />
<br />
In the second term of the above equation, feature-$p$ of $U_i$ gets multiplied by feature-$q$ of $V_j$ and the contribution to the rating $R_{ij}$ is controlled by the cross feature coefficient $(X_{UV})_{pq}$. The same feature crossings are also performed within user vectors in 3rd term and movie vectors in the 4th term.<br />
<br />
The interpretation of ther cross feature interaction terms could be made as follows: for the $U_i$-$V_j$ term, for example, if a user likes the actor Tom Cruise (a large value for $U_{ip}$), but she doesn&rsquo;t like dark suspenseful movies (a small value for $U_{iq}$), however, she likes the movie Eyes Wide Shut (even though it has a high value for $V_{jq}$), perhaps because an underlying reason that makes her not like dark suspenseful movies perhaps vanishes if Tom Cruise is in the movie. For a model to capture such a pattern, it has to allow some sort of <strong>nonlinear cross feature interactions</strong> between features $p$ and $q$.<br />
<br />
However, the gain in the addition of cross feature terms over the linear terms on the MAE Rate is a mere $1.5\%$:
$$\hat{R} = R_{lin} + R_{xft}$$
$$=&gt; Nonlinear\ Cross\ Feature\ Model: MAE (CV) = 0.615$$</p></li>

<li><p>My intuition is that cross features must play a crucial role in explaining the rating patterns in the user population. Yet, we&rsquo;re only adding $3 k^2$ more tunable variables that are aimed to capture this nonlinear pattern for the whole system of users and movies. On the other hand, the feature matrices $U$ and $V$ carry $(m+n)*k = 1,657,710$ independent tunable variables for the whole training set. For a typical value of $k=10$, the linear feature terms have approximately 850,000 more tunable variables than the cross feature terms.</p></li>

<li><p>The computational price paid for a mere $1.5\%$ increase in MAE Rate is that the runtime increased from $30\ sec/epoch$ for the pure linear model to $60\ sec/epoch$ when incorporating all 3 types of nonlinear feature crossings:
<p align="center">($U_{ip}$ ~ $V_{jq}$),&nbsp; ($U_{ip}$ ~ $U_{iq}$),&nbsp; ($V_{jp}$ ~ $V_{jq}$)</p></p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Note to self</strong>: I have to try<br />
1. Incorporating only the $X_{UV}$ term and removing $X_{UU}$ and $X_{VV}$ terms.  To test the importance of the 3 separate cross feature terms.<br />
2. Then learning an $X_{UV}$ term (13,849,300 new tunable parameters) for each user separately.
<br />
A better model that&rsquo;s aimed to capture the cross feature interactions for each user independently could incorporate a separate $X_{UV}$ tensor for each user. This would introduce $mk^2$ ($\approx$ 13,849,300) more tunable variables and might quickly become impractical, however, would be a curious undertaking to try on <code>tensorflow</code>.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="5-regularization">5. Regularization</h2>

<p>An $L_2$ regularization term applied naively on the feature vectors $U$ and $V$ would penalize all nonzero components. This would encourage the coefficients in $U$ and $V$ to be close to zero.  However, we would rather have the coefficients in $U$ and $V$ regress towards the mean rating of the corresponding user (or alternatively corresponding movie) instead of zero. And for the nonlinear cross feature terms I kept the regularization term naive to regress towards the value zero.</p>

<p>In essence, we are imposing a penalty for any behavior that diverges from the average pattern.  In this spirit, I formulated the $L_2$ regularization term as follows:</p>

<p>$$\Omega_{lin} = \sum_{i=1}^m\ \Big(U_i - \mu_{U_i} \Big)^2 +\sum_{j=1}^n\ \Big(V_j - \mu_{V_j}\ \Big)^2$$
$$\Omega_{xft} = \sum_{p=1}^k \sum_{q=1}^k\ (X_{UV})_{pq} + \sum_{p=1}^k \sum_{q=1}^k\ (X_{UU})_{pq} + \sum_{p=1}^k \sum_{q=1}^k\ (X_{VV})_{pq}$$</p>

<p>where,<br />
$\Omega_{linear}$: regularization term for linear features<br />
$\Omega_{xft}$: regularization term for cross features<br />
$\mu_{U_i}$: mean rating for user-$i$<br />
$\mu_{V_j}$: mean rating for movie-$j$</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">reg = (tf.reduce_sum((stacked_U - stacked_u_mean)**2) + 
       tf.reduce_sum((stacked_V - stacked_v_mean)**2) + 
       tf.reduce_sum((UV_xft**2)) + 
       tf.reduce_sum((UU_xft**2)) + 
       tf.reduce_sum((VV_xft**2))) / (BATCH_SIZE*k)
</code></pre>

<p>However, regularization didn&rsquo;t improve the MAE Rate because of the over abundance of data which is already the best implicit regularizer than any other explicitly imposed regularization term.</p>

<h5 id="shape-of-input-tensors-r-and-r-indices">Shape of input tensors <code>R</code> and <code>R_indices</code>:</h5>

<ul>
<li>A particular challenge in implementing a Matrix Factorization algorithm on <code>tensorflow</code> is that we can&rsquo;t pass <code>None</code> for the <code>shape</code> argument while declaring the input data tensors <code>R</code> and <code>R_indices</code> as in <code>R = tf.placeholder(..., shape=(None))</code>.  The <code>shape</code> parameter corresponds to the number of ratings a single batch contains. To make the SGD work, I had to fix the <code>shape</code> of the <code>tf.placeholder</code> variables <code>R</code> and <code>R_indices</code>  to <code>shape=(BATCH_SIZE, k)</code>.  This is a small price to pay which allowed me to build the collaborative filtering model on <code>tensorflow</code> and use GPU computation and symbolic differentiation. It was also easier to experiment with additional nonlinear terms in the loss function without having the worry about computing the partial differentials by hand.</li>
</ul>

<pre><code class="language-python">R = tf.placeholder(dtype=tf.float32, shape=(BATCH_SIZE,))
R_indices = tf.placeholder(dtype=tf.int32, shape=(BATCH_SIZE,2))
u_mean = tf.placeholder(dtype=tf.float32, shape=(BATCH_SIZE,1)) 
v_mean = tf.placeholder(dtype=tf.float32, shape=(BATCH_SIZE,1)) 
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>At each SGD step a mini-batch of ratings $R_{ij}$ and the corresponding user-movie index pairs $(i,j)$ are fed into the computational graph. For this, we have to stack the corresponding embedding vectors into 2-D tensors <code>U_stack</code> and <code>V_stack</code> where both <code>U_stack.getshape()</code> and <code>V_stack.getshape()</code> equal to <code>(BATCH_SIZE,k)</code>.<br />
The implementation of stacking tensors  on<code>tensorflow</code> is a little trickier than it would be in <code>numpy</code>:</li>
</ul>

<pre><code class="language-python">def get_stacked_UV(R_indices, R, U, V, k, BATCH_SIZE):
    u_idx = R_indices[:,0]
    v_idx = R_indices[:,1]
    rows_U = tf.transpose(np.ones((k,1), dtype=np.int32)*u_idx)
    rows_V = tf.transpose(np.ones((k,1), dtype=np.int32)*v_idx)
    cols = np.arange(k, dtype=np.int32).reshape((1,-1))
    cols = tf.tile(cols, [BATCH_SIZE,1])

    indices_U = tf.stack([rows_U, cols], -1)
    indices_V = tf.stack([rows_V, cols], -1)

    stacked_U = tf.gather_nd(U, indices_U)
    stacked_V = tf.gather_nd(V, indices_V)
    
    return stacked_U, stacked_V
</code></pre>

<h5 id="initialization">Initialization:</h5>

<ul>
<li>The feature vectors $U$ and $V$ are initialized by sampling from a Gaussian Distribution with mean $\mu = \sqrt{ 3.5/k}$, and standard deviation $\sigma = 0.2$. For the cross feature vectors $X_{UV}$, $X_{UV}$ and $X_{VV}$, the mean was chosen by practical experiments to be $\mu=-1/k$ and standard deviation $\sigma = 0.2$ as in the linear feature vectors.</li>
